# Hirst Painting Project

This project is inspired by the artwork of Damien Hirst, particularly his spot paintings. The aim is to recreate a similar aesthetic using Python and the Turtle module.

## Overview

The project involves the following steps:
1. **Extracting Colors**: Using the `colorgram` module, colors are extracted from an image file (`image.jpg` in this case). These colors are then stored as RGB tuples.
2. **Creating the Painting**: The extracted colors are used to generate a list of colors. The Turtle module is then utilized to draw a series of dots on the canvas, with each dot being filled with a randomly chosen color from the list.

## Setup and Usage

To run the project:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required modules by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` script to generate the painting.
